## Commits
*None -- this was a planning-only session. The resulting plan was implemented in Session 3.*

## Prompts

### Prompt 1
> we're building macos native app that allows user to figure out where disk space is used and clean things up. create a plan. ask questions if unsure or need more ahead information or feedback.

*This concise, collaborative prompt replaced the monolithic mega-prompt from Session 1. It produced the architecture and implementation plan (MVVM with actors, SwiftUI, treemap, smart suggestions) that was used for the actual build in Session 3.*
